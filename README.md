## Themepark Management System

Themepark is a place where people gets opportunity to have some fun with various games and events.So people can buy tickets at the entrance as packages and can use that tickets to enter the events.
In our system we simplified this process as much as possible and made the system to work almost independently without any person to watch.

The System includes three sub systems.

**1.  To Select the packages as required and purchase them.**
This system generates a ticket with a qr code according to the selection and installed at the pc of the entrance in the Theme Park. Designed the UI for touch screen with tappable size of controls.

**2.  To Recognize the qr code and show the status**
This system Recognize the qr code in the  ticket and allow or disallow the event for the person and installed on a pc at the entrance of each event.

**3.  Admin Panel**
Admin can view the sales and income with this system. This system is to be installed on the manager's pc.

This project was done as a second semester project.
Language used in this is C# and several libraries used to create additional features. 
QRCoder, EmguCV ( OpenCV wrapper for C#), ZXing and MetroUI libraries were used.
